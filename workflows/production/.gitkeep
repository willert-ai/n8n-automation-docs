# Production Workflows

This directory contains live, actively used n8n automation workflows.

## Guidelines
- Only deploy thoroughly tested workflows here
- Each workflow must have complete documentation
- Include monitoring and error handling
- Follow naming convention: `PROD_[ProcessName]_v[X.Y].md`

*Remove this file when adding the first production workflow.*
