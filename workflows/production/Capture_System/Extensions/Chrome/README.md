# Capture URL ‚Üí n8n Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that allows you to quickly capture the current webpage URL, title, optional comment, and location data to an n8n webhook for further processing and automation.

## üéØ Purpose

This extension streamlines the process of saving interesting webpages to your n8n workflow system. Whether you're researching, collecting resources, or building a knowledge base, this tool helps you capture web content with a single click, including your current location for context.

## üîó Complete Project Ecosystem

This Chrome extension is part of a larger automation system:

- **Chrome Extension** (this component) - Captures webpages with comments and location
- **[n8n Workflow](../../Workflows/Capture/Capture_URL/)** - Processes captured data and triggers automations
- **Webhook Integration** - Seamless data flow between extension and workflow

The complete system allows you to:
1. Capture any webpage with a single click
2. Add personal comments and notes
3. Include your current location (optional, privacy-controlled)
4. Automatically process the data in n8n
5. Trigger follow-up actions (save to database, send notifications, etc.)

## ‚ú® Features

- **One-click capture** - Click the extension icon to capture the current page
- **Optional comments** - Add personal notes to your captures
- **Location capture** - Include your current position (privacy-controlled, opt-in)
- **Multiple capture methods**:
  - Click the extension icon in the toolbar
  - Use keyboard shortcut `Alt+Shift+S`
  - Right-click on any page and select "Capture this page"
- **Custom webhook configuration** - Set your own n8n webhook URL
- **Privacy-first design** - Location capture is disabled by default
- **Success/error notifications** - Visual feedback for each capture
- **Structured data** - Sends clean JSON data to your n8n workflow

## üìä Data Format

The extension sends the following JSON payload to your n8n webhook:

### With Location Enabled
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/page",
  "title": "Page Title",
  "comment": "Your optional comment",
  "captured_at": "2025-01-27T10:30:45.123Z",
  "geo_location": {
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "accuracy": 10
  }
}
```

### With Location Disabled
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/page",
  "title": "Page Title",
  "comment": "Your optional comment",
  "captured_at": "2025-01-27T10:30:45.123Z",
  "geo_location": null
}
```

## üîí Privacy & Location Data

- **Opt-in by default** - Location capture is disabled by default
- **One-time permission** - User grants location permission once in settings
- **Non-blocking** - URL capture works even if location fails
- **5-second timeout** - Won't delay capture if location is slow
- **Clear privacy notice** - User understands what data is collected
- **User control** - Easy toggle in settings
- **Network-based location** - Uses network location (~50m accuracy) for privacy

### How Location Works
The extension uses browser's geolocation API with network-based positioning (not GPS) to preserve battery and privacy. Location data includes:
- **Latitude & Longitude** - Your approximate position
- **Accuracy** - Precision radius in meters
- **Timestamp** - When location was captured

## üîß Technical Details

### Permissions Required

- `activeTab` - Access to the current tab's URL and title
- `storage` - Save webhook configuration and location preferences
- `scripting` - Inject prompt dialog into pages
- `contextMenus` - Add right-click menu option
- `notifications` - Show success/error messages
- `geolocation` - Access to device location (when enabled)

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (Manifest V3)
- Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, etc.)

### Geolocation Implementation

The extension injects geolocation code directly into the webpage context to capture location:
- Uses `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`
- Network-based positioning (not GPS) for privacy
- 5-second timeout to prevent delays
- Falls back to `null` if permission denied or error occurs
- Location data stored in Chrome's local storage

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Icon Generation

The extension icons were generated from the original `Capture.png` logo using Node.js and the Sharp library:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install sharp

# Generate icons
node generate-icons.js
```

### File Descriptions

- **`manifest.json`** - Defines the extension's permissions, icons, and behavior
- **`service_worker.js`** - Handles webhook communication, geolocation, and user interactions
- **`options.html/js`** - Settings page for webhook URL and location preferences

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check Developer Console**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions`
   - Click "service worker" under your extension
   - Look for error messages in the console

2. **Verify Webhook URL**:
   - Right-click extension icon ‚Üí "Options"
   - Ensure the webhook URL is correct
   - Test the URL in a new tab

3. **Check n8n Workflow**:
   - Ensure your n8n webhook is active
   - Click "Execute workflow" in test mode
   - Check n8n execution logs

### Location Issues

1. **Location Not Captured**:
   - Check if location capture is enabled in extension settings
   - Verify location permission is granted
   - Check browser location settings (chrome://settings/content/location)
   - Ensure you're not in incognito mode (location may be blocked)

2. **Permission Denied**:
   - Go to Chrome settings ‚Üí Privacy and security ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Location
   - Find your extension and enable location access
   - Or disable location capture in extension settings if not needed

3. **Location Accuracy**:
   - The extension uses network-based location (WiFi/IP) not GPS
   - Accuracy is typically 50-100 meters in urban areas
   - Less accurate in rural areas with fewer WiFi networks

### Common Issues

- **"Webhook not registered"** - Activate your n8n webhook by clicking "Execute workflow"
- **"Permission denied"** - Ensure the extension has all required permissions
- **"Network error"** - Check your internet connection and webhook URL
- **"Location timeout"** - Location capture has a 5-second timeout; this is normal
- **"No location data"** - Check if location services are enabled on your device
